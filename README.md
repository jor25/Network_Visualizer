# Network_Visualizer
Visualize how neural networks operate in real time.
Using pygame window to dynamically display how neural networks operate.
Inspiration came from boids project.

# Set Up:
* `pip install numpy`
* `pip install pygame`

# Resources:
* Inspired by this project to do a neural network visualization
